# Time-Series-Using-ARIMA-To-Predict-Train-Passenger-Numbers-In-Java-Island
This group project aims to analyze and predict the number of train passengers in Java Island using the *time-series analysis* approach with the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. This method was chosen because it is able to capture historical patterns and trends that allow for accurate forecasting of future passenger numbers. This project involves several stages, from data processing, selection of the best parameters for ARIMA, evaluation of results, to visualization of predictions. The prediction results are expected to support relevant parties in making decisions related to capacity planning and train operations on Java Island.
